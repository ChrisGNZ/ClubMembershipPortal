Please note that Logins are NOT the same as Users!

A Login is what we know about a successful authentication from our login provider 
(currently we only have one login provider - Auth0 - but that could change in future).

When someone is authenticated by Auth0 and thus has access to this site, we then work out what user they are.

At this stage I anticipate there will be a one-to-one relationship between logins and users, but that may be 
an incorrect view... We may need to revisit this!
