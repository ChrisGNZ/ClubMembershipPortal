Currently only Microsoft SQL Server is supported.  I don't like mySQL and I haven't the time to learn PostgreSQL.

At some point it might be worth refactoring the DB access to use a Repository design pattern to enable support for different database storage engines, 
but for now I'll leave it simple and specific to SQL Server.
